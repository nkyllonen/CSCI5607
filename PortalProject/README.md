# CSCI5607 Assignment5 : Final Project
### Emma Lacroix and Nikki Kyllonen (and Seth Johnson)
Repo for collaborating on CSCI 5607 (Intro to Computer Graphics) final project.

##### 19 December 2017 - Submission day update

This repo is currently split into the "master" branch along with three other branches. Emma and I have our own branches, "emma" and "NK_portal1" respectively, but there is also a branch that Seth Johnson made called "seth." In a last ditch attempt to pour ourselves into implementing true portal rendering, we asked Seth to help us and so we added him as a collaborator onto this project.

Currently, the "seth" branch has a primitive form of portal rendering with outlines and no recursion. "emma" and "NK_portal1" are not as up-to-date as the "master" branch since we used them to develop little things before we both migrated back to master without deleting our branches. As Seth tried his hand at the rendering, Emma and I pair programmed on the "master" branch and were not as successful. In order to get it to run as it did before, the portion of our rendering code we added to World::draw(...) is commented out so that the portals are merely rendering as colored ovals.
